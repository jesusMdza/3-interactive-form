Project: Form Validation

jQuery

For this project I was asked to use only jQuery to create
a form that validates user information. Information such as, user's name,
email, phone number, and credit card info.

User is also required to select an activity from the activity list.
A user is not able to select an additional activity that has the same
day and time of previously selected activity. 
Total price of activities is displayed at the bottom of section.

For extra credit, I was required to display error messages in real time
whenever a user filled required fields wrong. The default form
also needed to be styled while keeping the same format. Another
objective was to provide at least one field with two error messages.

One, the user can't leave the field blank, two, the user has to
use specific characters for field to be acceptable.
The "Name" field was my chosen field to have 2 error messages.
